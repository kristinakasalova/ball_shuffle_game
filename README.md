This is my first own JS project that I came up with and developed on my own, without any tutorial or similar.
The idea is to serve as an onscreen aid for Montessori and other child development related games with pompoms, colour circles or other similar material. The child clicks on the button and gets a fresh color pattern to recreate with their own material. 

I came up with the idea as I saw a set of cards a friend received in a speech therapy session as a way to support hand-eye coordination, color recognition and spatial orientation. There were only few cards available and it soon became boring to use the same ones repeatedly. 
Creating new ones by hand was a tedious job too, so I thought of it as a small project to put my JavaScript knowledge in practice.

The first viable web version for desktop was created in late May 2024 with only simple for loop re-assigning classes based on a random number function.

Here is backlog of features I would like to add in the future:
- custom color selection,
- vertical/horizontal alignment toggle,
- number of balls selector,
- repeating color checkbox.
